*Operators*

We do have special characters and binary digits in machine codes and due to the makeup of the system, therefore its align with the computational characters to make
specific search of information filtering out unrelevant document leading to actual keywords or response to a specific guven task, also to handling simple 
arithmetic functions to facilitating the execution of complex algorithms, like security encryption, operators play an important role 
in the programming world.
A search parameter in a Google dork is applied to a search on the search engine. Google has its own query language built in, and hackers use these queries to find 
sensitive files, track people and discover web vulnerabilities a simple search does not reveal
