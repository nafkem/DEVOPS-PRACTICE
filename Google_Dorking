‼️New Project Alert‼️

Google is an important tool to leverage on to enhance ones knowledge. As a cybersecurity student, you'll find yourself using Google more often than not to gather information and navigate your ways around the cyberspace. The problem with Google is the numbers of information that gets returned to user when queries are made. This can get daunting and sometimes, irrelevant pages which are of no use to the user, are mostly included. As a cybersecurity student, it is imperative to master the skill of efficiently using Google and being able to leverage on it to a great extent.

For today's project, we'll dive into the advanced world of Google by learning *Google Dork* (also referred to as Google Hacking). Google Dork is a search string or custom query that uses advanced search operators to find information not readily available on a website. It can be used to source for information that are difficult to locate through simple search queries.
